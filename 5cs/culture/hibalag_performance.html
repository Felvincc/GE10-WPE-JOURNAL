        <h2>Reflection / Description</h2>
        <p>
            Our band was invited to perform for the University Acquaintance Party with a week's notice,
            originally we declined because of the very short notice. But, the party was suddenly moved a
            little less than a month later due to reasons that I forgot (sorry), so we got invited to play
            again and we accepted. We were scheduled to perform at 7pm, but because of delays we performed
            at 9pm. The event was a fun experience that taught me a lot more on how setting up a big stage is like.
            One bad experience though was one of the bands took way too long in sound check, eating the soundcheck times
            for the rest of us bands, they got atleast an hour, and the rest of us got only 15 minutes from the agreed 40.
            The following are pictures of our performance. This activity made me realize that I should appreciate how far I've come
            a year ago, our band was thinking that performing for Hibalag would be the ultimage goal, but It feels like instantly that we 
            got the opportunity to do just that.
            <br><br>
            I believe this entry deserves 4 points, since we were one the main performers for the event.
